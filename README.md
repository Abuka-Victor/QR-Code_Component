## My process

For these type of projects, typically I love to design as I go. So a little html there, a little css to go with it immediately so the project slowly comes to life. I draw and color at the same time. :-)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Media Queries

### What I learned

The major thing I learned in this project is getting this little box to be responsive across devices. I played around a lot to understand the min/max-width and the min/max-height for my media queries and because I expereinced some bugs it made me read more about media queries and I learned that the order in which the media queries are written in themselves can also affect the output. Of course I learned that you can do cool stuff like this ⬇️ also

```css
@media (600px <= width >= 800px) {
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I would love to take a mobile-first approach just to see.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://www.css-tricks.com)
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org)

These helped me to learn better how to use media queries.
